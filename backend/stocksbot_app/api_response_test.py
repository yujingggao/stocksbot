We go down BIGLY from here", "!banbet AMD 110 4w"], "TV": ["My retarded assessment of Big tech names-\n\nApple- exposure to Chinese manufacturing will become a bigger and bigger liability as we enter the new Cold War over Taiwan. Will make Ukraine look like a walk in the park. A dying economy hurts luxury goods first and this will cause apple consumers to have to cut back, maybe not on the newest iPhones but maybe on those $200 air pods or the Apple TV subscription service. Not the best investment. \n\nAmazon- unionization will spread like wildfire at their warehouses and it\u2019s going to prevent them from being able to automate their supply chain. This will dramatically weaken half their business. If AWS split off of Amazon it would be an awesome investment as the king of the cloud, however with half the company going through this type of shit it\u2019s not worth it. \n\nFacebook- stuck between a rock and a hard place. Apple and google locking down ad targeting on their mobile devices severely hampers Facebook. Instagram getting hurt by TikTok. VR is a promising space and they\u2019re the uncontested kings of it at this point, but they\u2019re delusional to focus on \u201cmetaverse\u201d specifically when their own metaverse game looks so unpolished and shitty. They\u2019re like a google but without the moat. So you\u2019re left with the shitty moonshots which have low odds of success. Probably the most undervalued tech company on this list relative to their current earnings but it\u2019s tough to buy when we don\u2019t know how much cash they are going to throw in the furnace of metaverse or whether they can stop the TikTok bleeding. Imo they need to focus on acquisitions of smaller tech companies and use them for growth, rather than pissing it away on creepy, GameCube era lookin metaverse garbage. \n\nNetflix- Trash. Stopped caring about what the customer wants when they removed stars and then likes/dislikes. Lost a lot of its content from competitors like Disney taking it to their own platforms. Instead of diversifying it\u2019s business model in the face of massive competition, they chose to double down on original content, ignoring that they lack the IP\u2019s to ever compete in that arena. Now they\u2019re losing subscribers and caught in a death spiral of raising prices to increase revenue while the mounting competition gives consumers an easy excuse to jump ship. \n\nGoogle- only problem with google is they lack diversification. Super heavy in search, YouTube. They dominate these industries uncontested though. The SpaceX investment will likely be worth a lot some day. Only major risk is the rise of TikTok usurping YouTube but in reality both platforms have their niches and neither can really effectively take over the other as a result. Probably one of the better names on this list. \n\nMicrosoft- Easily the most diversified name on this list with lots of exposure to gaming, b2b, cloud, etc. they\u2019re only really the top dog in one of those (b2b) but they\u2019re consistently #2 everywhere else. Azure growth is ensured thanks to active directory integration and bundle discounts to companies already using Microsoft\u2019s other products (all of them). Gaming certainly isn\u2019t going away and they now own many of the biggest IP\u2019s in the industry with the Bethesda and activision(likely) buyouts. Really hard to poke holes in this company. Maybe revenue growth isn\u2019t the highest as a result of that diversification but in exchange you get very consistent earnings beats, something none of the other names here can do 100% of the time"], "TSLA": ["Sold my kidney last night and deposited it this morning.\n\nAll in TSLA puts.
